Please respect that we have put a healthy amount of time in the development, testing and the maintenance of this theme. You can use this theme free of charge according to the GPL license. However, we ask a small, yet completely optional, favor of you: If you like the theme, we would appreciate if you keep the credits in the footer of the theme in tact. We have intentionally made them small and not intrusive. It's a small favor for a project that, had you hired someone to design and develop this theme for you, cost several thousand dollars.

Important notes about this theme:
---------------------------------------------------

* The two menus that are supported by this theme do NOT extend to more than one line. If you have more menu items and they don't fit, the theme has to be customized to accommodate your needs. Generally speaking, it is good practice to keep the options that a user of your website has limited. If you find that you have too many top categories, we advise to minimize the amount of top categories and create your category logic more intelligently and *user-friendly*. Besides, if you use sub categories, they will be shown in a dropdown menu as supported by Arjuna.


About IE6 Support:
---------------------------------------------------

Obviously, the IE6 version of this theme looks a little different than the version displayed in modern browsers. We had tried to simulate the modern version as much as possible but due to the nature of the IE6 rendering engine, we had to make certain decisions to cut down on some visual elements (layout remains completely the same!). The only alternative that we considered for a short time was to use GIF transparency, however, the graphics looked jagged at many areas so we decided to create an IE6 only version of the theme with a simpler background than the original. We believe the result is more than acceptable. Remember the horribly designed websites that had been created back in the days where IE6 was launched? This is definitely not one of them.
Nonetheless, we still hope that IE6 will rest in peace soon.
