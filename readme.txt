Hello ;)

Beam is a multi-purpose, content & discussion centric WordPress theme.
Beam was created to serve as a multi-purpose, multi-device, simple yet elegant wordpress theme.

With Beam you can easily upload your logo, change header color and height. You can easily change page, sidebar or footer colors, too.
Show or hide Author Bio (as below) with simple On/Off switch. 
You can completely hide menus too with the same simple On/Off switch. Great for Landing/Sales pages, right?
