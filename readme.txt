= ADAM'S RAZOR =

* by adamlofting, http://adamlofting.com
* feedback on the theme is welcome here: http://adamlofting.com/adams-razor/

== BREAKING CHANGES ==
* V1.1 This theme no longer supports directly adding custom script tags or code to the header and footer via the theme options. This functionality should instead be managed through an appropriate plugin.

== ABOUT ADAM'S RAZOR ==

Features:

* Custom header image

* Option to include code (such as analytics javascript) before the </head> tag or </body> tag. See Appearance > Adam's Razor Options.

There are some deliberate functional limitations in this theme:

* Does not support multi-level menus with drop-down menus. For child pages I recommend using a Sub Pages Widget in the Primary Widget Area.
* Does not include an "Edit" link for logged in users as this is now offered in the standard wordpress toolbar.

Other notes:

* Theme modifies the default HTML output for the caption shortcode to remove inline styling
