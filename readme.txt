== Description ==

Avedon's framework is primarily built on a Bootstrap theme. The background image rotator is a javascript developed by Build Internet. If you like the functionality we certainly suggest tossing them a little "social support". The social buttons are based off a javascript called SocialCount - again, if you like it we suggest throwing them some support. The typographic options are provided by Google Fonts, which is an absolute must for any designer.  We have also included a decent array of OpenGraph meta options in order to keep your message syncronized throughout all the social networks out there.

Although donations are certainly welcome, the best way you can support out work is to purchase the Avedon Advanced theme. We have decided to forgo the online shops and offer it from our own website (since that'll allow us to minimize the cost to you). Once you've purchased Avedon Advanced you will recieve a download with the enhanced theme which includes...

- A built in Twitter feed
- Additional SuperSized background images (up to 12)
- Uncompressed CSS and JS (for easier editing)
- Access to our Git repository
- The ability to signup for our newsletter (so you can recieve theme updates and operationl tutorials)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Can you fix this thing?  If you have purchased Avedon Advanced and are recieving functional errors, you are welcome to submit tickets via the link you will recieve upon purchase. We ask two things from you in return - 1) Detailed explinations of what is causing the error (it does XXX when I do XXX) and 2) Courtesey. Please be mindful that support is not included with this theme - you have purchased a collection of code and images. That said, if a part of the theme is not functioning properly we are happy to fix the code when we have a chance. We are not a multinational company, we are a small staff of people who love web design and development. We've made every effort to build this theme a solidly as possible, but nothing is perfect and if you can repectfully help us make a better product then we're all fighting for the same cause.

Can you help me customize my theme?  Sure. Just shoot us a message from http://haeckdesign.com/contact and well shoot you a rough cost estimate.  We can't work for free, but we do damn good work and we do it at a fair price (that we'd be happy to estimate for you).

I'm having problems w/ Internet Explorer...   Please - stop right there. As any developer will tell you, Internet Explorer is the bain of our exsistance.  This theme has been tested and funtions (minus some javascripts), but we really don't put that much energy into making IE do anything cool... You can put a pig in a dress - but it's still a pig.  We realize there is still a ever shrinking minority of people who use IE, but the amount of effort it takes to make outdated browsers do modern things is an inefficient use of time.  There approach is fading away and honestly, we couldn't be happier.   Put simply - Don't ask us IE related questions unless you are on our client list.

Are you on the social networks?  Yes - and definelty shout us a holler! Here are a few links that you'll find us on, but certainly visit our website (http://haeckdesign.com) and check out the footer for the full list.
