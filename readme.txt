== Description ==

B3 is responsive customizable theme based on Bootstrap 3 framework. Three
widget areas, changeable colors and page look, export/import settings,
custom logo and background, image carousel, translation ready.

The content area is 3/4 of page width with sidebar of 1/4 on 980+ pixel
width screen, 2/3 content with 1/3 sidebar for medium screen,
and one-column for 750 or smaller screen.

== Navigation Bar ==

In Appearance/ Menu/ Manage Locations you can assign any custom menu as
theme Primary Menu. If none selected then the navigation bar shows menu
of all site pages. Multi-level dropdown works.

== Export/Import Theme Settins ==

Download lucky theme settings set as a file and then import it at any time.

== Image Carousel and B3 Slides Post Type ==

Custom post type 'b3_slide' serves homepage image carousel. To add slides
go to B3 Slides/ Add New, then enter slide title, description, upload image
and/or select featured image. 1140 x 300 pixel image size is recommended
for best look. Slides with 3.8 width/height ratio are being displayed also
entirely. Bottom part of less ratio images is hidden.

Also B3 Slides post type can be used to display wide pages (no sidebar)
with featured image under the content. In case you bump into Not Found
on a single slide page you need to update permalinks setting.

== Page Templates ==

To display static pages choose default or wide template (without sidebar).


== Auto Colorizing Feature ==

When you select custom color for links, the color for hover links will
be changed prorgammatically to more dark as selected color. In a similar
manner the second color for navigation bar gradient is being assigned.
Analogously, post icons (of post date, user, category, tags) color is
calculated from main text color.
