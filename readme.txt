Chip Life 1.5 is a major update so i will strongly recommend to backup the old version of Chip Life before testing the new one.
Several new features have been added and many of old one are obsolete now.
Code Architecture and Design of Chip Life has been changed in order to make it more professional and for the regular future updates.

Short "Site Title/ Description" is best and Image Logo of suggested dimenstions (280x60) is ideal for design.
