Hi!
This theme has a custom post type that lets you add posts to a frontpage slideshow,
it comes with 4 different headers and also supports sticky posts and nested comments.
The theme uses custom menus in the header and footer: Create a new menu in the tab and chose it as your primary (or footer) menu. 
The menu is designed to hold approximately 5 menu items, depending on the length of your titles.
I recommend a screen resolution higher than 1024 x 768.
The theme is ready to be translated and already includes swedish language files. 
Note that the code is sometimes commented in both english and swedish. In those cases, the swedish comment is to the right.

Folders included in this theme:
images
scripts -contains the jquery used for the slider.
languages -contains language files.
psd -contains photoshop (psd) files for the images used. This folder can be deleted.

Single-slider.php is the template that shows sliders as full posts.
slider.php is the file that contains the slider.

If you have any questions or suggestiosn for this theme please contact me at myazalea@hotmail.com.
