= Description ==

Star is a responsive, accessibility-ready blogging theme. Features include Call to action that will grab your visitors attention and help you feature different parts of your website. The theme has two optional menus (including a social menu) and two widget areas that will hold any number of widgets. We recommend that you install the Jetpack plugin to make full use of supported features like logos, featured content, contact forms, social sharing and favicon. To create a portfolio, install Jetpack and create your projects, all the templates are already shipped with the theme. Star also works well with Woocommerce and BBpress.
