Description: Figure/Ground is a bold blogging theme featuring a dynamic background and extensive customization options. 
License: GPLv2

== Description ==
Figure/Ground is a bold blogging theme that transforms your site into a dynamic, visually stimulating canvas of abstract shapes and content.

Meticulously designed on a responsive 64-pixel square grid with a 16-pixel sub-grid, Figure/Ground features comprehensive customization options including the ability to customize every color and alternate "Circular" and "Orthogonal" modes.

Your content flows down the center of the page, blending into the background animation in an alternating sequence, before coming to the widgetized footer. A fixed header features space for a small site logo, a search bar, and a togglable menu. Wide and full-width images break across the canvas with support for the block editor (Gutenberg).

From its bold design to its out-of-the-box functionality and easy customization, Figure/Ground is sure to make your site memorable!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Supported Colors =
It is extremely important that your two selected Figure/Ground colors have adequate contrast with each other, as they are alternately used as the foreground and background colors throughout this theme. But don't worry about looking up how to calculate color contrast. Figure/Ground automatically ensures that the bare minimum color contrast guidelines are met, and will adjust your color selections as needed to do so. If you find that the resulting color is significantly different from the one you selected, it's best to find your perfect shade within the general brightness of the generated color.

Additionally, contrast between accent colors and their respective figure/ground colors is checked and adjusted as needed.
