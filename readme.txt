== Description ==
Arbutus is a minimalist photography theme that transforms your site into a visually stimulating canvas of cleanly layered images and content.

Meticulously designed with simplicity in mind, Arbutus displays your content with no distractions. Arbutus features opinionated post format designs so that all types of content can be displayed in a way that captures the attention of your viewers. The home page includes an optional header image or video, which is displayed in a large featured section with your site logo, title, and tagline. Arbutus is packaged with three beautiful default header images, and you can upload your own images as well.

Arbutus is named for the genus of trees and shrubs that includes the Madrone native to the Pacific Northwest and the modern hybrid Marina Strawberry tree. Arbutus is optimized for use across all platforms, ensuring that the viewer sees the content as intended regardless of the device they're using. Arbutus is a theme that emphasizes images and content through a simple modern design, providing a site experience that your users are sure to enjoy.

1. Go to the Customizer (Appearance -> Customize) to select your header image, and to customize widgets, menus and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Setting Featured Images =
The featured image should be set using the featured image section rather than inserting the image into the content editor. If desired, you may still put images into the post content in addition to the featured image or gallery. If no featured image is set, the theme will automatically search through your post content for an image to feature. If there are no images there, the fallback image (configurable in the Customizer) will be used as needed.

= Blurry/Small Featured Image =
If your featured images are displaying blurry, try using the "Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin to reset your image sizes. Also make sure that the uploaded image is at least 1600x900 pixels. 

= Slow Loading, Featured Image Sizes, and Retina Support =
After extensive testing, featured image display had been optimized to maximize image quality while minimizing loading time. Images are automatically sized to 1600x900 pixels on upload, but the full size image is available when users click the full sized image button, giving users access to higher quality versions. Even with this optimization, users on slower internet connections may experience unavoidable delay in images loading for certain posts.
