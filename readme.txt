Overview:
---
Redesign is a clean highly visible theme suitable for businesses, small businesses Ð or blogging. There are two navigation menus, a custom header, custom background, transparent graphic elements and four widget areas: header widget, two sidebar widgets, and a footer widget.

The transparent graphic elements makes your custom background image visible through the layers. Or by choosing a background color, the hole site will have this color, in different shades. An easy and fast way to create smooth graphic design.

Redesign combines the simplicity of the old WordPress themes with all the new functions of WP 3.x The Redesign theme is not based on any other WP theme. It«s made fram scratch.

The theme is responsive, and easy to read in handheld units. A smartphone will show one column Ð a tablet two columns Ð and a computer three columns. No information is hidden; the sidebar columns are stacked under the main column when handheld units are used. Scroll to read.
