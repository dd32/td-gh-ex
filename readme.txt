http://overhaulindustries.com/adept/

Adept is a versatile theme with a custom theme admin page to set colors, add your contact info and analytics tracking code. Adept is built for speed with seven widget positions; three in the sidebar and four in an extended footer. Users will also appreciate the light page weight, around 100k! 

Clean design, suitable for a wide range of applications; and ideal for business use. Design enthusiasts, will appreciate the fixed width layout composed using a hoizontal grid and featuring a baseline grid for text alignment. To visitors this makes the site 'look and feel' right!
