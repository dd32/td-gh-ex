ABOUT THEME
=========== 
Inspired by popular viral media sites like Upworthy.com and Viralnova.com, Virality is a simple blog theme with all the options you need to build you own site in this style. Built in social sharing, the ability to turn off all the extraneous navigation and post meta data, and total control over the color scheme, background image and logo with no coding required.

This theme is compatible with Wordpress Version 3.4 and above and it supports the new theme customization API (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API).

Supported browsers: Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari and IE9+ (Media queries and some css3 styles like shadows, rounded corners and 2D transform are not supported by IE8 and below).
