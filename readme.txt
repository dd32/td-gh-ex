== Acknowledgements ==

Way back in 2010, the original version of Weaver was developed by Bruce Wampler. Over time,
the original "2010 Weaver" evolved into Weaver, then Weaver II, and now this version,
Weaver Xtreme. This latest version could not have been developed with out the considerable
contributions of the Weaver Forum moderators, scrambler, Joy, Gillian, and Joerg. These
great people did extensive testing, provided feedback, and contributed both ideas and code.
My sincere thanks to them all, as well as many other Weaver II users who also contributed
with testing and feature suggestions.
