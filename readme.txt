== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I add widgets? =

Apostrophe includes four optional widget areas: three in a Sidebar alongside your content,
and one area in the footer of your page.

The three widget areas on the side differ only in background color. You’ll usually want
to use just a single widget in the primary section, which has a bright background to attract
attention. This is a great place to put a newsletter subscription or some about text.

The footer widget area is less prominent and is useful mainly for links. Widgets in the
footer area are stacked horizontally, so if you put a lot of widgets here, your page may
get quite long. Custom Menu widgets work best in the footer area. Note that adding
widgets to the footer will disable Infinite Scroll for your theme.

If you haven’t added widgets to the Sidebar, Apostrophe will act as a single-column theme.

Configure these areas by going to Appearance → Widgets in your Dashboard.

= Does Apostrophe use Featured Images? =

Apostrophe relies heavily on Featured Images. If a Featured Image is set for a post,
it will display on the blog index and archives. Otherwise, a plain box will appear
in the grid with an icon to indicate your post's format.

= Does Apostrophe have social links? =

Apostrophe ships with support for over 20 social networking websites, including Twitter,
Facebook, Google+, YouTube, GitHub, Tumblr, and others. To add social media icons to
the theme, you’ll have to create a new menu under Appearance → Menus.

1. Create a new Custom Menu, and assign it to the Social Menu location.
2. Add links to each of your social services using the Links panel.
3. Icons for your social links will automatically appear in the footer.

Supported networks: Codepen, Digg, Dribbble, Facebook, Flickr, Google+, GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn,
Pinterest, Polldaddy, Pocket, Reddit, Skype, Stumbleupon, Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, WordPress, Youtube, and feeds (RSS).

Unsupported links will appear with a simple star icon. You can replace this icon by editing your site's CSS.

= How do I use Featured Content? =

Featured posts in Apostrophe are a bit unique. To mark posts as featured, you’ll first have to configure
the Featured Content module from Appearance → Customize → Featured Content.
You’ll be able to select a tag for all your featured posts.

The simplest way to tag your posts is by using the front-end tagger. Simply visit your homepage, hover over
the post you'd like to feature, and click on the star icon. You'll notice the Featured Image for that post
then doubles in size. Featured posts will always display at twice the width of normal posts, and they're a
great way to add variety and interest to your homepage. Apostrophe will look best with about one Featured Post
for every four standard posts.

= Can I remove the author panel below my posts? =

Sure thing! The author panel will appear by default if your blog is written by more than one author. To hide it,
simply check the "Hide author bio panel on individual post pages" checkbox under Appearance → Customize → Theme.

= How do I use special classes? =
