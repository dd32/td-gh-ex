CHANGELOG
=========
Version 1.0 - oktober 2013


INSTALLATION
============

1. Extract shipyard.zip and upload the theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory, or login into WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Install Themes.
2. Go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard > Appearance > Themes and select this theme to activate.
3. Once activated, you're ready to use it.


HOW TO SET HOMEPAGE
===================
You can use the default homepage (displaying posts) or set a static page as homepage. 
To set a static homepage login into WordPress Dashboard > Settings > Reading and select the page you want.


HOW TO CHANGE HEADER IMAGE
==========================
You can change the header-image via WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Header. I advice you to use a header-image of 960px wide and 350px high. 
The default header (boats.jpg) is from my private collection and I don't mind you will use it for your blog.


HOW TO SET MENU
===============
Shipyard offers two menu's: one in header and the second one in footer. Menu in head can contain subpages (2 levels deep).
You can set menu via WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Menu's and select the menu you want.


TRANSLATION
===========
This theme is translation-ready (Dutch translation included). 
You can translate this into your own language using for example plugin Codestyling Localization: http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/
