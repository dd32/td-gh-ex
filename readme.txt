=== About ===
* WordPress theme framework with 21 files and 3 sub directories, 
* Up to date code standards as of June 2014.
* This is not a Theme, per se, and is only a starting point for those in need of a good WordPress starter package.
* For reference use only. 
* Most all page templates included. 
* Most all styles selectors included with some attributes to get you started.
* A good enough functions file to pass Theme Review and present up-to-date methods.
* Most HTML5 semantics used when possible
* nav-menu.php left for possible usage as get_template_part where you can put a menu in any page or content-page (left, right, top, bottom) other than the typical header.php file.
* not a lot of time spent on styles (styling) but there are every WordPress custom style selectors that I know of as part of the stylesheet. If you find more email me to add them to the version.
* creating left or bottom sidebar should be easy enough by just following the existing format of adding a new registered sidebar to functions.php and then add the appropriate changes in style.css to change the content div to float left or make it full width and add a footer "sidebar" or two or three.

== Instructions ==
* Replace theme slug "tswframer" with your theme slug and have fun
