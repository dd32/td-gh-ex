===================================

The theme has been tested on all major browsers including Firefox, Opera, Chrome,  
Internet Explorer and Safari. Your browser should have JavaScript enabled to make this theme work!

The theme works on the latest Wordpress version without any problems. Previous versions have not been tested
and are not supported. I suggest to update your wordpress installation, especially due to security flaws.
