**===== Description =====**

Aperture is a modern and responsive photographers theme with a fullscreen slider; perfect for artists and photographers wanting to showcase their art. Aperture supports all post formats (standard, quote, link, image, gallery, aside, status) and this combined with it's clear typography (Droid Sans and Oswald) makes Aperture a great theme for bloggers too! Aperture easily adapts to your needs. Use it with or without sidebars, add a copyright line at the bottom, add up to 18 social media icons or add a second menu: it's all up to you!

**===== Notes =====**

To use the frontpage slider: 
	1.- Go to a page or add a new one. 
	2.- Select 'Slider Template' at the right side under 'Page Attributes'.
	3.- Go to the customizer.
	4.- Add your images under the 'Fullscreen Slider Images' tab.
	5.- Don't forget to add the page to your menu! ;)

The fullscreen background, copyright text, social media icons and the slider texts can all be set in the customizer.

This theme is one of the first themes to support the upcoming Jetpack Portfolio Custom Post Type.
