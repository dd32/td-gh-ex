Annarita is a very lightweight and adaptable theme based on HTML5 and CSS3.
It lets you to create custom menu, sidebars, header image, background and support
for featured images and it shows a special ribbon for "sticky" posts. It has the
support to customize some settings of the theme. The sidebars can be hidden by the
users with a click and this status can be persistent (if the admin enables the
relative setting saving the preference using cookie in the Settings page). Basically
it supports related posts and microformats as hcard and hreview (using a custom post type).
For the reviews the theme has a custom widget to best show them. Annarita has two dedicated
areas to publish advertisements, one above the header and one in the footer.
