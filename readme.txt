== Installation ==

1. Primary: Login to your wp-admin area and go to Appearance -> Themes. Select Install tab and click on Upload link. Select theme .zip and click on Install now button. If you have any errors, use alternate method.
2. Alternate: Unzip the template file (Ascreen.zip) that you have downloaded. Via FTP, upload the whole folder (Ascreen) to your server and place it in the /wp-content/themes/ folder. Do not change directory name. The template files should thus be here now: /wp-content/themes/Ascreen/index.php (for example).
3. Log into your WP admin panel and click on the Design tab. Now click on the Ascreen theme to activate it.
