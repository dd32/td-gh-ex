=== About ===
-! Setting the number of posts to show on your home page is the most important part of getting a even number of posts to show on the home page. Set to multiples of 4.
-! Lead article page will show the latest post in top box of front page - home.php template.
-! The content for each new page of posts will show without the lead article in pagination.
-! Note that top row menu area does NOT SUPPORT DROP-DOWN MENUS! This is a static inline menu only.
