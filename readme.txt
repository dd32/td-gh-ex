== Notes ==
* Requires WordPress 3.6 or higher!
* All navigation to main top menu is parent recursive. If you have a menu with sub pages then the top link will not be 
clickable. This is to prevent conflict with mobile navigation. A mobile device will not be able to tap on the top parent 
link and use any of the child links below it.

ToDo: flatten search button and resize
