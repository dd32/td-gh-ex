1. Go to your WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Themes.
2. Select and install a new theme from the online WordPress Theme Directory or from your pc (zip file).
3. Once activated, you're ready to use it.

You can use the default homepage (displaying posts) or set a static page as homepage.

To set a static homepage go to your WordPress Dashboard > Settings > Reading and select the page you want.

You can change the header image via WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Customize. 

You will find the recommended size there too.

= Menu = 
You can create and set a menu via WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Menus.

The mobile menu supports 2 levels of subpages.

= Create a knowledgebase =
The knowledgebase uses the default WordPress categories and posts.

Create a new page and select the knowledgebase page template. You can choose between 3 columns (with sidebar) and 4 columns (without sidebar).

Show or hide page title, exclude a category, set amount of posts for each category and order posts by date or name via WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Customize.

Parent and subcategories are listed the same way.

If you want this page to be homepage go to Settings > Reading and select this page as hompepage.

= Create a link portal =
To display a list of website links you can install this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/page-links-to

While creating a post you can add the URL (website) of your choice.

When you click the post link in frontend it will redirect you to this URL (so the post will not open).

= Seach bar title =
You can change the search bar title via WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Customize.

= Browser support =
The knowledgebase might not display 100% in IE8 and older because I have used css selector 'nth-of-type'.
