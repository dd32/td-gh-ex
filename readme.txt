HOW TO SET HOMEPAGE
===================
You can use the default homepage (displaying posts) or set a static page as homepage. 
To set a static homepage login into WordPress Dashboard > Settings > Reading and select the page you want.


HOW TO CREATE A KNOWLEDGE BASE 
==============================
The Knowledge Base uses the default WordPress categories and posts.
Create a new page and select the Knowledge Base template on the right. You can choose between 3 columns (with sidebar) and 4 columns (without sidebar).
If you want this page to be homepage, Go to Settings > Reading and select this page as hompepage.


HOW TO CREATE A LINK PORTAL 
===========================
If you only want to display weblinks you can install this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/page-links-to/
While creating a post you can add the URL (website) of your choice.
Clicking the postlink will redirect you to this URL (so the post will not open).

I advice you to use a header-image of 600px wide and 400px high.
