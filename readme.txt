Hi!
This theme has a custom post type that lets you add posts to a frontpage slideshow,
it also supports sticky posts and nested comments.
The theme uses a custom menu in the header and footer: Create a new menu in the tab and chose it as your primary menu. 
The menu is designed to hold approximately 5 menu items, depending on the length of your titles.

The theme is ready to be translated and already includes swedish language files. 
Note that the code is sometimes commented in both english and swedish. In those cases, the swedish comment is to the right.

Folders included in this theme:
