A) Requirements
===================================

The theme has been tested on all major browsers including Firefox, Opera, Chrome,  
Internet Explorer and Safari. Your browser should have JavaScript enabled to make this theme work!
For example the DropDown Navigation need Javascript to work.

The theme works on the latest Wordpress version without any problems. Previous versions have not been tested
and are not supported. I suggest to update your wordpress installation, especially due to security flaws.

   1. Automatic Installation
      Go to WP-Admin > Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme and choose the theme zip folder.

   2. Manual Installation
      Upload the theme files to your wordpress theme folder wp-content/themes and activate the theme in
      your wordpress admin panel. That's it!
