Skylark is a simple portfolio/business WordPress theme with multiple page templates. 


// Changelog

// Regarding the logo and main menu

The logo is using the 'Maven Pro' font from Google Web Fonts.

For best results, try keeping the number of parent pages to a maximum of 6. Lower if you have a longer site title. If you have a lot of pages, simply adjust them so they are sub pages.

// Homepage slider setup

1. To setup the slider section, you need to create a post under the 'My Projects' custom post type. 
2. For your featured image, please make sure the dimensions are the following: 680px x 476px.

// Call to Action section
The homepage features a random 'call to action' section. To take advantage of this, simply create a post under the 'Call to Action' custom post type.

For best results, keep the content short.

// Work Section & News Section

1. For content to appear under the 'Work' section on the homepage, you need to create a post under the 'My Projects' custom post type. 

For best results, make sure your featured image is at least the following dimensions: 680px x 476px.

2. We realize that some may want to change the following on the homepage:

'Work
A collection of our most recent projects'

'News
Our latest news and announcements'

To adjust the above, you'll need to edit the 'index.php' file

// How to create a 'Portfolio' or 'Work' page

To create a portfolio/work page, simply create a page titled 'Portfolio' or 'Work.' Before publishing, please be sure to select one of the following page templates:

Portfolio Template Two Column
Portfolio Template Three Column
Portfolio Template Four Column

For items to appear in these page templates, you need to create a post under the 'My Projects' custom post type. To make your items filterable, while create a post under the 'My Projects' custom post type, simply create a 'Skill Type' which is located to the right of the post editor.
