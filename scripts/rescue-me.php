<div class="subtone"><H4 class="subtone-h4">Previews slightly out?</H4></div><p class="tenip">All previews are approximations. Some of the sizes/layouts may look sligly different in the admin panel to how they look in the real theme. Problems can also occur when Plugins change the CSS in the admin panel and this can cause problems. If you do find something breaking the previews, please let us know so we can fix it!</p>	<div class="subtone"><H4 class="subtone-h4">Image Boxes</H4></div><p class="tenip">When an image is being called, if you dont want one, please either write "none" or "x" in the box, or else it defaults to the old image if you leave it blank. This is a quirk were aware of!</p><div class="subtone"><H4 class="subtone-h4">Anything Broken</H4></div><p class="tenip">If you do find anything broken (Its a big lump of code and there has to be mistakes somewhere!) it would be really cool if you would tell us so we can fix it!

Please either remove the image and use a solid color, of download the free PSD and create a better background image.</p><div class="subtone"><H4 class="subtone-h4">Faster!!</H4></div><p class="tenip">With so much code and so many options, 42k may lag slighly behind other themes. Were working on a list of ways you can improve your installation; such as deleting unneeded options.</p>
