About style.css:

Traditionally, a child theme provides its own style.css to override or extend the
parent style.css. This usually involved adding an "@import" to the child's style.css.

Weaver Xtreme handles the main style sheet differently. It is called "assets/css/style.weaverx.css",
and is loaded before the theme "style.css" file. Thus, there is no need to "@import" the
parent stylesheet.

So you can make overrides and extensions directly in this child style.css.
