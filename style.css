Theme Name: Customizr
Theme URI: http://www.themesandco.com/customizr
Description: Customize your website live from the admin customizer screen : choose a color skin (among seven elegant skins), upload your logo, set up your social network profiles and you are done!  The clean and fully responsive design can be used for any type of site: corporate, portfolio, business, blog, landing page, etc. The theme also includes a responsive slider generator (with call to action text and button) to make your pages or posts look beautiful. It supports five widgetized areas (two in the sidebars, three in the footer), up to three columns, nine post formats with special styles, and comes with seven elegant skins and three handy featured page blocks for the front page. Customizr is built with HTML5 and CSS3 upon the Twitter Bootstrap framework.
