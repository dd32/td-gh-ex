Description: Customizr is a clean, responsive and easy to customize theme. Customizr allows you to design your website in live, directly from the WordPress Customizer screen : skin choices, logo upload, social networks icons, sidebar layouts, home page slider. Customizr is coded in HTML5 and CSS3 and built upon the Twitter Bootstrap framework. It is cross browser and compatible with smartphones, tablets and computer screen devices. It includes a cool responsive slider generator (including call to action text and linked button) that can be used for any pages or posts. The theme supports five widgetized areas (two in the sidebars,  three in the footer), up to three columns, nine post formats with special styles. Every post or page can be displayed with a specific layout (full width, right and/or left sidebar) and its own slider.  It also comes with seven elegant skins and three handy featured page blocks for the front page.
