Some notes on creating a child theme:

1. This directory contains a very minimal example of an Weaver Xtreme Child theme.

2. You can use functions.php to write functions to override any function in the main theme that is wrapped by
   an "if (!function_exists('func_name'))" check. These are known as "pluggable" functions. Many of the original
   definitions are found in functions.php, but othere are found elsewhere in the code.

3. You can provide a complete replacement for template-type files in the parent. These are files that generate
   output HTML directly such as 404.php, archive.php, or footer.php. You can tell these mostly because they
   generate lots of HTML that will make up the final output page, and that many of them are used
   by the "get_template_part" function.

4. This sample code will work with the Weaver Xtreme Basic theme or the Weaver Xtreme Plus plugin.
