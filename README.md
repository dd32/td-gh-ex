<h1>Adam’s Razor Wordpress Theme</h1>

This project was only meant to be a little bit of fun when I was learning the ins and outs of building Wordpress themes, but its extreme simplicity has actually held it's own over time. 

It's an exercise in leaving out as much as possible, in terms of code, styling and design and it's _philosophically_ minimal, rather than loyal to a particular minimal aesthetic. 

Without getting carried away with “design”, I have now added a custom header image to the banner area at the top of the page. The main reason for this was that I became too confused when I saw other blogs using the same theme as my own! This small touch allows a lot of personalisation without turning the use of the theme into a time consuming design exercise. 

You can see the project and change log here:

The theme can be installed from the Wordpress repository directly from the admin, or from here:
