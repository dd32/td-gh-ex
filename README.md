Artist
===

Aiming to be the ultimate theme for artists. Will probably be frequently updated. Feel free to contribute code on GitHub. Here are some features so far:

* A responsive layout.
* A cool, mobile-first menu.
* Gratuitous use of Genericons (GPL!)
* A couple Unsplash photos, ideal for custom header images.
* Widgetized footer expanded by Plus icon.
* A homepage template with Jetpack Portfolio support.
* That's pretty much it. Everything else just works.

Setting Up the Homepage
---------------

1. Install the Jetpack plugin.
2. Activate the Custom Content Types module and enable Portfolio in Settings > Writing.
3. Start making portfolio items with featured images and categorize them, preferably in multiples of three.
4. Make a new page and select the "Homepage" template instead of the default.
5. Set a featured image on your new page to act as a divider between your page content and portfolio content.
5. Set it as your actual homepage in Settings -> Reading.
6. Voila, you have successfully set up the Artist theme homepage.

Support
---------------
Free support is not guaranteed. Support forums on WordPress.org may not be monitored.

If you have uncovered a veritable bug, open an issue on GitHub. If confirmed, it'll make it's way back on WordPress.org.
