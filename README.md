Puro WordPress Theme
====================

A content focussed minimalist theme, perfect for your blog, portfolio or small business site. We've closely integrated SiteOrigin's Page Builder for responsive layouts and MetaSlider for smooth, easy to build sliders. Puro is responsive, Retina ready and fully compatible with Jetpack, Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms and WP PageNavi. Included is a .pot file ready for translators and a .rtl CSS file for left to right languages.
