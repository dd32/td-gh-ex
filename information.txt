The Theme is set to show 6 posts per page.
To change the number of posts per page, you have to edit the number of post to show in the index.php of the theme too.
This is the special line in the index.php: <?php $post_counter++; if($post_counter == 4) : ?>

12 articles in 2 columns
<?php $post_counter++; if($post_counter == 7) : ?>

8 articles in 2 columns
<?php $post_counter+articles in 2 columns+; if($post_counter == 5) : ?>

6 articles in 2 columns
<?php $post_counter++; if($post_counter == 4) : ?>

quasi
<?php $post_counter++; if($post_counter == Posts to show ÷ 2 + 1) : ?>
